The solution is for Leetcode's problem number 258, Given a number n, we need to find the sum of its digits such that sum becomes single digit. for example for Input  38 the Output should be 1. This can be Explained as The sum of 3+8 = 11, Hence answer will be 1+1 = 2, similarly for Input 0 Output will be 0. A brute force approach is to sum all the digits until sum < 10. There exists a simple and elegant order of 1 solution for this too. The answer is given by simply. If a number n is divisible by 9, then the sum of its digit until sum becomes single digit is always 9. For example, Let, n = 2880, Sum of digits = 2 + 8 + 8 = 18 and continuing with 18 as  18 = 1 + 8 = 9. A number can be of the form 9x or 9x + k. For the first case, answer is always 9. For the second case, and is always k. Let us see the implementation of the above idea.
